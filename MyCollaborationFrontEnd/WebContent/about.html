<h2>It is an Collaboration Project.</h2>
<h3>Collaborative project management is based on the principle of actively involving all project members in the planning and control process and of networking them using information, communication, and collaboration modules.<br> Management is not regarded as an activity reserved solely for managers but as an integral part of the project work of all team members.
Collaborative project management makes extensive use of localized control loops. Complex projects are broken down into smaller "more tangible" sub-systems which are then assigned to members of the relevant departments. Consequently, planning and control responsibility is assumed by those who are also responsible for project content.<br>
Sub-plans are networked and synchronized to tie all partners into the system of planning and control and to promote a common understanding of overall planning. Changes and/or delays are communicated directly to the relevant project members without active intervention in their areas of responsibility.
The technical platform on which collaborative project management builds is a central database that makes current and consistent planning data available to all project participants wherever they may be located.<br>
Communication and collaboration are the basis for early identification of the impact of potential problems on linked sub-projects. They create a high level of transparency and a shared awareness of quality among team members.</h3>
